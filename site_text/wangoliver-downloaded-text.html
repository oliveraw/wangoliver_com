About Me
Welcome to my website! Learn more about who I am, what I’m interested in, and some of my personal projects. This site was intended for fellow students, potential employers, and any miscellaneous supporters out there.

I’m Oliver Wang, a student at the University of Michigan studying computer science and business. In my free time, you’ll probably find me hanging with friends, playing video games, or reading a book.

If a post I wrote here genuinely helped someone learn something interesting, either about a topic or myself, then this website will have been a success. Feel free to email me if you have any comments or suggestions, I’d love to hear them!

I’ve been playing piano on and off for about 10 years and am currently working on learning some Chopin nocturnes.

Why Computer Science?
No other school subject has made me lose track of time like computer science. I’ll be scouring webpages, trying out code samples, reading articles and StackOverflow posts, and before I know it hours have passed. It just feels like there’s not enough time to learn it all. 

Projects in computer science have felt different to me than anything else—at times I feel completely absorbed and consumed.


My go-to coding focus playlist
I was having trouble making my code fast enough for last semester’s final project, and thoughts of trees, big-O, and algorithms followed me even as I was out walking or making dinner. I’d often work on something right before I fell asleep and have dreams about coding—one time I literally woke up and the solution had appeared in my brain like magic.

There are moments in your life when you just feel a spark. I feel those more in computer science than anything else. When you’ve been staring at a screen for days and finally, finally you run your code and it works—its electric! I wish every person could experience those coding “aha” moments. 

Why Business?
My dad has shown me firsthand how liberating and exciting it is to run your own company, to work for yourself instead of others.

When I was younger I’d go in the garage and help him repackage auto parts for his side business. I’d return emails from his supplier in Korea and send invoices to our one single client. My dad started another company in 2014—Drinkmate—which is now SodaStream’s main competitor and the world’s #2 home carbonation machine.

I knew I wanted to do the same thing—to create a project of my own and bring it to fruition. To make something real and valuable for the world and leave my mark. I didn’t have such clear goals at the time, but I kept my eyes and ears open for any opportunities I might grab.

In high school, I met an upperclassman who told me about his side hustle reselling sneakers, and I thought it would be an interesting way to make some money. He taught me everything he knew, his methods and tricks for buying exclusive items. 

I was hooked. I’d be on my phone in my classes waiting on websites to drop clothes or shoes. I’d wake up at 3am to watch the Yeezy website release their newest sneaker.

I joined Discord groups, followed sneaker twitters, went on online forums. For a while I was fully committed to studying and understanding how streetwear resale worked.

Researching, testing things out, and eventually making a profit felt so satisfying. It wasn’t so much about the money—it was more that I made it in an unconventional way, that I studied and learned and took advantage of an opportunity that others around me didn’t see. 

I only found the opportunity because I was willing to talk to someone and have a conversation, which I also see a lot of in my business school classes and interactions. There are so many opportunities and things to learn from those around you—the next thing that changes your life could be just a conversation away.

Business to me is about taking and creating opportunities that are unconventional, finding your niche and taking advantage of any chances you see. Networking and learning from others’ experiences are hugely important to me—being social as part of the job is the main reason I’m a business major.

Creating a new app or software is great, but in the end, business is the lever that moves the world. Getting your product out there to real people in the world takes connections and business sense. Computer science gives you the skills to create something, while business provides the skills to market it—you need both to create a successful venture.
